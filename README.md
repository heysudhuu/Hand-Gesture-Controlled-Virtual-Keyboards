# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Keyboards
Control a virtual keyboard using just your hand gestures! Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, this project detects finger taps to simulate real-time typing â€” no physical keyboard needed. A touchless, interactive take on human-computer interaction.
